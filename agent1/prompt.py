agent1/prompt.py — Prompts for Agent 1.

Two prompts are used:

EXTRACTION_PROMPT
    Instructs the model to extract structured facts from the article and
    return them as a JSON object.  Guided decoding enforces the schema.
    Unchanged from previous version.

SENTIMENT_COT_PROMPT
    Instructs the DeepSeek-R1 model to write chain-of-thought reasoning
    about the article's market sentiment inside ``<think>…</think>`` tags.
    The model stops at ``</think>`` (via vLLM ``stop=["</think>"]``).

    The scoring phase in ``vllm_logits_client.get_real_choice_logits``
    then appends ``</think>\\n`` + ``SENTIMENT_DECISION_PREFIX`` and reads
    the model's genuine token-level log-probabilities for each class label
    (POSITIVE, NEGATIVE, NEUTRAL) via ``SamplingParams(prompt_logprobs=1)``.

    The model is NOT asked to output logit numbers or a JSON object.  All
    probability calculations happen in Python from the real model logprobs.

SENTIMENT_DECISION_PREFIX
    Short string appended after the CoT to create the decision context.
    The model's next-token distribution at this point is scored for each
    choice label.  Must end with a space so the choice token attaches
    cleanly (e.g. "Sentiment: POSITIVE").
